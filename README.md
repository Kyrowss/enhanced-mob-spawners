# Enhanced mob spawners
Attempts to add vanilla friendly features to the Spawner block. Such features are:
- Make Mob Spawners minable with silk touch
- Right-click on a mob spawner and it will drop its monster egg corresponding to what type of entity inside.
- Adds a chance for all entities to drop its monster egg
- Adds Spawner Block in Creative Tabs (decorations)
- Modify Mob Spawner stats such as count, speed and range. Example: make spawner active for a maximum of 128 blocks! Vanilla is 16
- Customize what you want inside mod configuration file
- Toggle spawner ON/OFF with in-game config menu or Redstone
- Option to turn on limited spawns, via config file! Control number of entities a spawner can spawn before it dies. (currently only on latest fabric version)
